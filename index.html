        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a third year student at Illinois Institute of Technology and currently
            majoring in Computer Science. I plan on getting my master's as well through
            the coterminal program. I am also a member of the Men's Swimming and Diving
            Team here. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, video games,
            listening to music, and cooking!
        </p>
        <p> This year, my roommates and I got two kitties from a friend who found them in
            his garage. Honestly, taking care of them while managing school and swim has
            been more difficult than anticipated. However, they're super cute, so definitely
            worth the effort.
