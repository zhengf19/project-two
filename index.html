        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am a third year student at Illinois Institute of Technology and currently
            majoring in Computer Science. I plan on getting my master's as well through
            the coterminal program. I am also a member of the Men's Swimming and Diving
            Team here. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, video games,
            listening to music, and cooking!
